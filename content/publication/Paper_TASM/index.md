abstract: This study attempted to construct a finance AI technology phylogenetic tree that represents the evolutionary pattern of finance AI technology and quantitatively measures the level of ethical attributes in the treeâ€™s technological topics. Based on the tree, it was confirmed that the finance AI technology field is evolving in the direction of three research topics in 2021 -  deep learning, machine learning, and decision-making technology. Through NLP methodology, we proposed a model to measure the extent to which fairness, human right and normality, transparency and accountability, privacy and security, explainability, and performance guarantees are discussed among these topics
